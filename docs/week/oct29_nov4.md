The change starts with the teachers being leaders. Turning from faceless functionaries to inspirational leaders.
</span>

<span class="desc">
The Indian Education System has long suffered from apathy, apathy that has manifested top down.
Previous attempts to improve India’s dismal education system had focused on teachers, the classroom and the curriculum – never on principals.
</span>

<span class="desc">
To counter this apathy one of the approach is to change the outlook to the problem, finding and nurtring educationists as leaders. The programme is run by the Foundation for Education Leadership, set up by Piramal, whose founders come from Jhunjhunu.
</span>

<span class="desc">
The role demands a totally different skill set. They have to build a team, engage the village, motivate the staff, create a positive atmosphere, and use resources well. Managing a school is like running a small business.

Its astounding to find out that the likelihood of women working in India languishes at the very bottom in G20 with Saudi Arabia and take this there contribution to economy is 1/6, half the global average.
</span>

<span class="desc">
Knowing what we know about the dismal state of women's involvement in India's economy, imagine the possibilities in this economy that has doubled in size over the recent years once there is a structural push women involvement.
</span>

<span class="desc">
A rise in female employment rates to the male level would provide India with an extra 235m workers, more than the EU has of either gender, and more than enough to fill all the factories in the rest of Asia.
</span>

<span class="desc">
The world’s biggest democracy would be 27% richer.
</span>

<span class="desc">
Per reports, as households become richer, they prefer women to stop working outside the home. The mindset has to change.
