Read: This Week's Latest Initiative \u00b6 To provide critical content that caters to the understanding of India, its Geo-Political, Social, Economic and Demographic change & impact at a macro level with nuance. To elevate from stories with a narrow perspective and see where the bigger changes fit in for a country that is going through transformation at a pace like never before, We need better content to reach more people and build better prespectives. More often than not the trending/popular stories divert the attention and understanding from changes happening that are slowly and steadily transforming the economy and society. We intend to cater that content and build a more informed perspective. Collaboration & Crowd-Sourcing \u00b6 We need more people to collaborate on and curate stories for the next week to incorporate more opinions, diverse point of views and further better understanding.
